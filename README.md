# C# implementation of the Minimax algorithm
Developed for educational purposes, it enables my high school students to develop small AI projects.

The implementation closely follows the pseudocode from [Russell](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) And [Norvig's](http://www.norvig.com/) [Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach 3rd Edition](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/), with the exception of some minor points.
